## What was submitted to the IEEE as abstract

We are living in an age of the “Internet of Things”(IoT) and “Internet of Self”(IoS), pervasive and omnipresent electronic media and “quantified self” at the physical and biochemical levels. In turn, these tools, particularly those that enable real time monitoring of self in the form of glasses, watches, wearable computing devices, and fabrics can these be harnessed for education?
The use of video is now ubiquitous in learning situations including the use of short video sequences demonstrating practice exercises and instructional sequences (eg Khan Academy) allowing anytime anywhere study. Rapid learning from the future and its associated self model theory (Dowrick 2012) draws on over four decades of self modeling using purposefully constructed videos. These have been used to teach, through observation, individuals skills and procedures that they are not able to achieve at present, but by viewing a possible future depicting the individual successfully engaged in achieving, rapid learning takes place usually within several viewings. These Feedforward video clips are typically less than two minutes in length (Dowrick 1976). Thus there is now an opportunity to merge through comparison and contrasting how the two technologies compare with each other in furthering education.
Despite several implementations of the self measurement technologies, it is not clear how self modeling and emergent technologies based on the Internet of Things, wearable computing, and personal monitoring devices compare and contrast with each other to further education. We need to be clear we are talking about the opportunity to learn. To make an opportunity become a learning experience we need the individual to engage in a cognitive process, wearing or carrying a device provides the opportunity, cognition the learning.It is clear that the internet of things and the internet of self (personalized learning opportunities) play and will continue to play a huge part in the developing world. Hence the objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of the literature in the form of a systematic review and meta analysis of the effectiveness of wearable computing and “Internet of Things” for learning and teaching effectiveness, and compare and contrast the results, and the technological implementations with what is known about the Internet of self  through the effectiveness of self modeling. Such a comparison will be helpful in predicting the potential success and may provide new directions for the use of the emergent tools.
The organization of the paper will be in three parts as follows: a brief background history of the emergence of the Internet of Things, the concept of video self modeling and describe their potential in changing teaching and learning practices in the tertiary sector particularly in professional education a systematic review of the effectiveness of the emergent technologies (Internet of things, and wearable computing devices) for educational purposes, and finally, we shall provide a synthesis of how the more effective technologies can be compared, contrasted, and combined with the practices of self modeling to foster effective learning.
We shall select English language intervention studies published in the last 10 years. The review, will critically appraise information identifying possible biases, ascertain the quality of the studies, and rank order the publications. We will estimate summary effect sizes for differing combinations wherever possible.
The resulting discussion of on the Internet of Things and self will inform pedagogical tools for rapid learning.
